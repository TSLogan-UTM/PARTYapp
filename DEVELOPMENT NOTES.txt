DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

I figured this would be a good file to add to help us communicate with eachother so I'm 
adding it to the project today. Should have thought of it sooner.

11/14/19-------

TSL:
- Got all the GUI elements added to the project and formatted correctly for the screen on my PC.
  Please double check me to make sure it is behaving correctly on your screen too.  
- Added code so the program now opens maximized by default.
- IMPORTANT! I have added all the GUI elements to the program's Resource Dictionary inside the
  App.xaml file so they should be accessible from anywhere in the program by using
  'Source="{StaticResource Red}"' when referencing the images. Please don't change any code in
  the App.xaml file in the <ResourceDistionary> section that looks similiar to:
  "<BitmapImage x:Key="TopBar" UriSource="assets\TopBar.jpg"></BitmapImage>".
- Text fields were created as Text fields, Create Button was created as a button, neither have
  any action scripting done yet.
- Color pallet options were created as individual images so hopefully we can script actions 
  for those too.
- THANKS!
